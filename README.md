# Youtube Cleanup Chrome Extension

A small chrome extension project to do small changes to youtube interface

## Uploading from WSL

This project was uploaded from WSL to a Chrome Browser for a local machine. The exact folder path for this is pretty hard to guess - one way to do so is to run the following command: `explorer.exe .` in the directory. That would provide a Windows explorer window which we can then copy and paste the path for it into the `chrome://extensions` page.
